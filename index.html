    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="http://sethsd.com/">Seth Stephens-Davidowitz</a> 
        is data scientist who uses Google searches 
        to measure numerous controversial topics, such as racism, sexual preference,
        and preference for sons. 
        His book <a href="http://sethsd.com/everybodylies/">Everybody Lies</a>
        provides compelling data-driven evidence
        that traditional surveys are often inaccurate,
        as people lie to themselves, surveys, and others. 
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Stephens-Davidowitz hypothesizes that people
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/opinion/campaign-stops/if-they-google-you-do-you-win.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fseth-stephens-davidowitz&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection&_r=0"> query for many things in search engines that they would not admit to others</a>.
        Thus, looking at search query data is a more accurate way of
        understanding what people are really thinking about, 
        than conducting traditional surveys.
      </p>

    <h2> Proposal </h2>

    <p>
      We hypothesis that wherever the largest collective attention is focused upon
      would be the best predictor of the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, many surveys prediction that Clinton would win the 2016
      presidential election.
      However, her opponent Trump was discussed online more extensively than
      Clinton, often in a variety of negative ways,
      more so than Clinton.
      Despite a considerable amount of negative attention, 
      Trump won the election. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As another example, Kim Kardashian is often in a news,
      often for a variety of less than positive reasons.
      Nevertheless, she was the 
      <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2016/11/130172/kardashians-highest-earning-reality-stars">
      top earning reality star in 2016</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Google Trends shows search activity 
      on specific keywords across time and space.
      We propose using the Google Trends data to predict the popularity of
      political candidates and other prominent people in the news,
      as search queries tend to be a better predictor of what people care about
      than traditional surveys.
    </p>

    <h2> Preliminary Work </h2>

    We obtained data from Google Trends using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-trends-api">Google Trends API</a>. 
    Our preliminary work is in this github repository and supports our hypothesis.

    </ul>
