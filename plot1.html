    <h2> US Presidential Election 2016 </h2>

    <p>
      We surveyed the average and total popularity index for Hillary Clinton 
      and Donald Trump for the month before the Nov 8 election day.
      A higher index means greater search activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      We found an average activity index of 44.57 for the search phrase "trump"
      and an average activity index of 38.36 for the search phrase "clinton".
    </p>

    <p>
      There was also greater activity for negative search terms Trump.
      We found an average activity index of 47.09 for the search phrase "hate trump"
      and an average activity index of 43.9 for the search phrase "hate clinton".
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, there was a higher collective interest in the
      election winner Trump in general, 
      both from people who had positive/neutral and negative feelings about him. 
    </p>

    <h2> UK Vote to Exit the European Union 2016 </h2>

    <p>
      We surveyed the average and total popularity index for Brexit 
      (Leaving the European Union) 
      and Bremain (Remaining in the European Union) 
      for the month before the June 23 polling day.
      A higher index means greater search activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      We found an average activity index of 57.29 for the search phrase "brexit"
      and an average activity index of 4.27 for the search phrase "bremain",
      a significant different.
    </p>

    <p>
      We found the total activity index of 545 for the search phrases related to "brexit"
      against a total activity index of 100 for the search phrases related to "bremain",
      again a significant difference.
    </p>


    <p>
      Thus, there was a higher collective interest in Brexit than Bremain.
      Ultimately, the UK voted for Brexit.
