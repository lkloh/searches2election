    <h2> French Presidential Election 2017, First Round </h2>

    <p>
      We surveyed the average and total popularity index for the 
      French Presidential Election candidates
      for the month before the April 22 - 23 election day.
      A higher index means greater search activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      We searched for trends for the names of the four main candidates.
      We found an average activity index of 40.03 for the search phrases "Emmanuel Macron",
      53.6 for "Marine Le Pen", 24.03 for Francois Fillon, and 40.03 for "Jean-Luc Melenchon".
      Ultimately, Macron and Le Pen won the most votes and would face off in the second round. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, there was a higher collective interest in the
      election winner Trump in general, 
      both from people who had positive/neutral and negative feelings about him.
